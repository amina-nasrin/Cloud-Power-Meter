**Bridging the Gap in Power Measurement for Heterogeneous Cloud**

[![IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing](https://img.shields.io/badge/IEEE-Transactions%20on%20Sustainable%20Computing-blue)](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSUSC.2025.3607207)

## üìå Overview
Cloud Power Meter (CPM) is a **machine learning‚Äìbased framework**. It provides **accurate, real-time power estimation** across **heterogeneous cloud environments** (AWS, Azure, GCP, and Chameleon Cloud)‚Äî**without requiring administrative privileges**.

This work has been **accepted in IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing (2025)** and addresses one of the most pressing challenges in modern computing: **energy inefficiency in cloud infrastructures**.  

By combining a **decision tree** for cross-platform adaptability with a **multi-variable polynomial regression model**, CPM matches the precision of Intel‚Äôs RAPL power model while being deployable on commercial cloud VMs.

1. **Deploy CPM** on a cloud VM.  
2. **Collect host specs** (CPU model, frequency, cores, memory, instance type, etc.).  
3. **Decision Tree** locates the closest-matching ‚ÄúCPM Instance‚Äù from training data based on collected host specs. 
4. Collect CPU Utilization for deployed workload. **CPU utilization is normalized** based on allocated vs. physical cores.  
5. **Polynomial Regression Model** estimates real-time power consumption.

  - **Decision Tree classifier** maps unseen VM specifications to the closest known instance (aka "CPM Instance") from the dataset. 
  - **polynomial regression** provides accurate predictions across diverse workloads with Decision Tree output and normalized CPU utilizations.
    
- **Accurate ML-based Power Estimation**  
  - Outperforms 14 existing power models.
  - Outperforms TDP-based measurements by far.
  - Matches the accuracy of Intel RAPL without needing root/sudo access.  

- **Cross-Cloud Adaptability**
  - Validated CPM across multiple commercial and academic platforms with heterogeneous hardware configurations.  
  - Works across AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and academic testbeds.  

- **Massive Real-World Validation**  
  - Analyzed **~2.6 million VMs from Microsoft Azure**.  
  - Discovered **>80,000 kWh of potential monthly energy savings**, where 17% of VMs wasted energy due to underutilization.  

- **Sustainability Impact**  
  - Helps providers and enterprises reduce costs and carbon footprint.  
  - Demonstrated practical applications for reducing costs, conserving energy
  - Provides actionable insights for **green cloud computing** and compliance with emerging **GHG emission disclosure laws**.

## üìä Case Studies & Results
- **SPEC Benchmarks:** Demonstrated CPM‚Äôs superior accuracy across 11 workloads.  
- **Chameleon Cloud:** Validated adaptability on unseen hardware.  
- **Commercial Clouds (AWS, Azure):** Proved CPM‚Äôs effectiveness under strict privilege limitations.  
- **Microsoft Azure Dataset:**  
  - Nearly **40% of VMs never exceeded 5% CPU utilization**.  
  - Identified **366 idle VMs wasting ~15,000 kWh in a month**.  
  - Energy optimization through core downgrading achieved up to **59.12% savings**.
