## üìå Overview
Cloud Power Meter (CPM) is a **machine learning‚Äìbased framework**. It provides **accurate, real-time power estimation** across **heterogeneous cloud environments** (AWS, Azure, GCP, and Chameleon Cloud)‚Äî**without requiring administrative privileges**.

This project was recently **accepted in IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing (2025)** and addresses one of the most pressing challenges in modern computing: **energy inefficiency in cloud infrastructures**.  

By combining a **decision tree** for cross-platform adaptability with a **multi-variable polynomial regression model**, CPM matches the precision of Intel‚Äôs RAPL power model while being deployable on commercial cloud VMs.

## üöÄ Key Contributions
- **Accurate ML-based Power Estimation**  
  - Outperforms 14 existing power models.  
  - Matches the accuracy of Intel RAPL without needing root/sudo access.  

- **Cross-Cloud Adaptability**  
  - Works seamlessly across AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and academic testbeds.  

- **Massive Real-World Validation**  
  - Analyzed **~2.6 million VMs from Microsoft Azure**.  
  - Discovered **>80,000 kWh of potential monthly energy savings**, where 17% of VMs wasted energy due to underutilization.  

- **Sustainability Impact**  
  - Helps providers and enterprises reduce costs and carbon footprint.  
  - Provides actionable insights for **green cloud computing** and compliance with emerging **GHG emission disclosure laws**.

## üî¨ How It Works
1. **Deploy CPM** on a cloud VM.  
2. **Collect host specs** (CPU model, frequency, cores, memory, instance type, etc.).  
3. **Decision Tree** locates the closest-matching ‚ÄúCPM Instance‚Äù from training data.  
4. **CPU utilization is normalized** based on allocated vs. physical cores.  
5. **Polynomial Regression Model** estimates real-time power consumption.

## üìä Case Studies & Results
- **SPEC Benchmarks:** Demonstrated CPM‚Äôs superior accuracy across 11 workloads.  
- **Chameleon Cloud:** Validated adaptability on unseen hardware.  
- **Commercial Clouds (AWS, Azure):** Proved CPM‚Äôs effectiveness under strict privilege limitations.  
- **Microsoft Azure Dataset:**  
  - Nearly **40% of VMs never exceeded 5% CPU utilization**.  
  - Identified **366 idle VMs wasting ~15,000 kWh in a month**.  
  - Energy optimization through core downgrading achieved up to **59.12% savings**.
